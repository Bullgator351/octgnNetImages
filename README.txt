Toy project to create an image downloader for select games on OCTGN

Downloads uncensored card images to be used by the application.

Features:
  Netrunner
  AGoT 2.0
  Warhammer 40k Conquest (up to Planetfall Cycle: Decree of Ruin)

NOTE: "Official" OCTGN image packs will usually contain higher quality scans. If an official pack is
available, consider installing it first, and run octgnNetImages after. Any pre-existing images will
not be overwritten.
